## Project 1 - Time Use Analysis

#### Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into time use gender differences across the world, by analysing the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Time Use Database. 

#### Data Sources
- The OECD Time Use Database
  - consolidates datasets of large-scale time-use surveys conducted by national statistical agencies. Surveys classify day-to-day activities across the duration of 24 hours (1,440 minutes).  The dataset provides the average time use for OECD countries plus China, India, and South Africa.

#### Tools
- Pandas

  - data visualisation

#### Data Analysis
- What is the mean time taken for daily activities?
- Which countries record highest and lowest times for activities?
- How does time use vary by gender, region and country's income level?
- How does time use vary between countries with low and high gender differences in
  - leisure time?
  - over all activities?
- What is the relationship between time for activities and GDP per Capita, for men and women?
